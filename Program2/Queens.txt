Our goal
-Queens in non attacked places

Our Choice
-Where a new queen is placed

Our constraints
-An already threatened space

Undo Choice
-Once a choice is made undo it

Queen's attack
-row
	all spaces that share the (X,Y) same X
-column
	all spaces that share the (X,Y) same Y
-diag1
	row minus column
-diag2
	row plus column

The Plan
1) Start in the leftmost column
2) Check if all queens are placed, if so return true
3) Test every row for a possible queens 
   While testing rows check for the following:
    a) Can the queen be placed here without attack? Save space [row, column] and recursively check if Queen's placement leads to a solution.
    b) If this placement leads to a solution return true
    c) If not unmark [row, column] and backtrack to step a) with another row
3) If no rows work trigger false and trigger backtrack
